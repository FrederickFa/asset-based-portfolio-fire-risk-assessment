    "This tool is a prototype that allows stakeholders to assess the risk of fires (especially wildfires) in their financial portfolio.
                    Stakeholders can select or upload their portfolio and identify which physical assets of the companies in their
                    portfolio are currently in the proximity of fires. The aim is to identify among thousands of physical assets in a financial portfolio those
                    that deserve special attention when analysing fire risk. This tool does not take into account the characteristics and vulnerability of an
                    asset and does not calculate/forecast material damage or financial costs. Furthermore, due to the combination of different
                    data sources, some information may be partially incorrect. Also, some of the fires could be under control, have an industrial origin
                    and therefore do not actually pose a risk to a property. The features and advantages of this prototype shown here are the use of granular,
                    near real-time and open-source data and being transparent in terms of data sources, assumptions and modeling. This tool has been developed independently and is not associated with any organisation."

                    available, namely the energy, cement and steel/iron sectors. In general, each tangible asset is assigned at least one owner
                    (sometimes more than one). While some data sources already assign parent companies to the owners of a physical asset and even disclose the Legal
                    Entity Identifiers (LEI, find more information", a("here", href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei"), ") of the owner and/or parent,
                    e.g. in the data of the Spatial Finance Initiative, this is not the case for other data sources. Since company names vary across sources, consistent IDs
                    such as LEIs are extremely important to combine different data sources. Therefore, in a second step, a name matching algorithm is applied to match owners and parents
                    contained in the raw ALD dataset with the corresponding names in the Global Legal Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) Level 1 data. For this purpose, this tool builds
                    on the work of the 2Â° Investing Initiative and its package, ", a("r2dii.match", href="https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.match/articles/r2dii-match.html"),

                    letters. The matches can then be assigned the corresponding LEIs. In a third step, the LEIs can be used to loop through the ownership structures of the companies
                    (level 2 data of the GLEIF) and link the owners of physical assets to the actual listed company."

                    (displaying 200,000 fires would slow down the application), and on the other hand it helps to identify the risk of larger / more intense fires,

                      risk can still be high. Furthermore, users should have the possibility to upload their portfolio. In addition, the functionality of the filters can be improved, e.g. re-calculating distances based on the chosen inputs.
                      And finally, more hazards will be integrated in the tool in the future."
